PART 2 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

I have added 3 tests to your tests folder: one for addition, one for multiplication, 
and one for branches (including beqinc). You can run them in the same way you did 
in part 1. For now, I have commented out the tests for your ALU and regfile, but if
you want to test those as well, you can open up tests/sanity_test.py and uncomment
the other tests at the bottom.

For each test, you can find the MIPS code that is running (and possibly some helpful
hints for analyzing the code) in the tests/assem folder. You can find the compiled 
instructions in the tests/hex folder. And you can find the expected output in 
tests/reference_output.

All 3 of these tests will fail if you have not yet pipelined your circuit. 

I have also provided "non-pipelined" versions of the addition and multiplication tests.
If you would like to check your partial solution against these, you'll need to open 
tests/sanity_test.py, go to the end, and uncomment the non-pipleined versions.
